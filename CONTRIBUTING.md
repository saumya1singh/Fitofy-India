 # General Guidelines 
 
 * Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on, so that you send a PR from that branch instead of the base branch on your fork.
* If you’d like to create a [new-issue](https://github.com/SaumyaSingh1/Fitofy-India/issues/new), please go through our [issue-list](https://github.com/SaumyaSingh1/Fitofy-India/issues) first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. 
* Have a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
* If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.
